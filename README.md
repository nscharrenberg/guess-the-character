# guess-the-number
A simple prototyping project for a Neural Network that guesses the number you draw

# Used Tools
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

# Why was this created?
In order to gain more knowledge about Neural Networks and TensorFlow, i wanted to make a simple application where I could learn the basics of a neural network and to get started with TensorFlow.

# The Concept of Guess the Number
The concept is simple, you draw a number and the neural network will try to guess what number you wrote down.

# Installation Guide
